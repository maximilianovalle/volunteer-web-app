//  Controller: responsible for handling incoming requests and sending responses back to the client - act as intermediaries between routes and application logic. They receive requests, process them using models or services, and then return the appropriate response.

// ! - Controllers get the requested data from the models, create an HTML page displaying the data, and return it to the user.
